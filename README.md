# vz-newrelic-5g-edge

>A Terraform configuration for deploying a multi-AZ EKS cluster within Verizonâ€™s 5G zones in AWS Wavelength. We are also experimenting with deploying both New Relic and Pixie using Terraform as part of this repo.

## Installation

1. Clone the [vz-newrelic-5g-edge](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/vz-newrelic-5g-edge.git) repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/vz-newrelic-5g-edge
cd vz-newrelic-5g-edge/wavelength-cluster
```

2. Next, initialize Terraform within your working directory.

```
terraform init
```

3. Edit `terraform.tfvars.example` with any specific configuration details, such as your EKS cluster name, and specific Wavelength Zone(s) of interest.

```
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

4. Apply the configuration:

```
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

## Deploy Pixie and New Relic

We've intentionally kept this install as a separate step due to issues with cleaning destroying the cluster outlined in this [github issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm/issues/593).  After the cluster has been successfully deployed, deploy Pixie and New Relic to the cluster using the `pixie_nr_module` in the `pixie-newrelic` directory.

1. Change directory to `pixie-newrelic`
```
cd ../pixie-newrelic
terraform init
```

2. Update config variables for the `pixie_nr_module`.  Some defaults have been set but feel free to override them according to your preferences.  The `nr_license_key`, `pixie_api_key` and `pixie_deploy_key` variables must be set for a successful deployment.  These can be obtained from the New Relic Guided Install for Kubernetes UI.

```
module "pixie" {
  source = "./pixie-nr-module"

  nr_bundle_infra           = true  # installs the New Relic Infrastructure Daemonset
  nr_bundle_prometheus      = false # installs the New Relic Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration
  nr_bundle_webhook         = false # installs the New Relic Metadata Injection Webhook
  nr_bundle_ksm             = true  # installs Kube State Metrics
  nr_bundle_kube_events     = true  # installs the New Relic Kubernetes Events Integration
  nr_bundle_logging         = false # installs the New Relic Logs Integration (Fluent-Bit)
  nr_bundle_pixie           = true  # installs the New Relic / Pixie Integration
  nr_bundle_pixie_chart     = true  # installs the Pixie Operator
  nr_bundle_infra_operator  = false # installs the New Relic Infrastructure Operator (Fargate-only)
  nr_bundle_metrics_adapter = false # installs the New Relic Metrics Adapter
  patch_pixie               = true  # enables the necessary patching so Pixie will run successfuly in a Wavelength cluster

  nr_license_key   = "<NR LICENSE KEY>"
  pixie_api_key    = "<PIXIE_API_KEY>"
  pixie_deploy_key = "<PIXIE_DEPLOY_KEY>"
  cluster_name     = local.cluster_name

  kubernetes_host_info = {
    host                   = data.aws_eks_cluster.cluster.endpoint
    cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(data.aws_eks_cluster.cluster.certificate_authority[0].data)
    token                  = data.aws_eks_cluster_auth.cluster.token
  }
}
```

3. Deploy the integrations

```
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
