# vz-newrelic-5g-edge

>A Terraform module for deploying a multi-AZ EKS cluster within Verizonâ€™s 5G zones in AWS Wavelength. We are also experimenting with deploying both New Relic and Pixie using Terraform as part of this module.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository for the [vz-newrelic-5g-edge module](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/vz-newrelic-5g-edge.git)

```
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/vz-newrelic-5g-edge
cd vz-newrelic-5g-edge/wavelength-cluster
```

2. Next, initialize Terraform within your working directory and create a preview of your deployment changes.

```
terraform init
terraform plan
```

3. Next, edit `terraform.tfvars.example` with any specific configuration details, such as your EKS cluster name, and specific Wavelength Zone(s) of interest.

```
mv terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

4. Apply the configuration by running `terraform apply.`
